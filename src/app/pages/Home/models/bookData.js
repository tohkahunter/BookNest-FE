  description: `The wheels of destiny had turned, and a new reality was being spun into existence.

They had to keep calm. They had to keep strong. They had to survive. It was as easy as that.

"It's okay to cry now," Katie murmured. Jenni covered her face with her hands and wept. For her dead children, for the dead world, and for her newfound freedomâ€¦

Katie and Jenni have just witnessed the zombie apocalypse begin. Now they must flee their Texas town and find a safe place to make their last stand against the living dead.`,
